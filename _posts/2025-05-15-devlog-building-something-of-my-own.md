I have been thinking of building something of my own for some time now. Something impactful, something interesting to work on. There is a "chull" in my mind that I want to fill with my  own work. But the mind goes blank when I try to think about what to build. Should I do some independent research? Build a product, a startup, some side hustle? Hmmm......
