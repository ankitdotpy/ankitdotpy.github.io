## About Ankit
I am currently working as Deep Learning Engineer at [TensorGo Software](https://www.tensorgo.com/), working majorly on machine learning, llms, and data analysis. I graduated from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Gwalior in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology.

My areas of interest are building efficient machine learning systems such as distributed training and inference, low resource NLP, and machine learning in general. I also want to get into amateur robotics, once I have other things sorted out. Currently trying my hands at blogging to share my long form thoughts on Programming and AI.

Always on lookout to work on intersting project..
